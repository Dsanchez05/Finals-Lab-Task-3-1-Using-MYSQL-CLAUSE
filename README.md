# Finals-Lab-Task-3-1-Using-MYSQL-CLAUSE

In this task, I am working with a MySQL database named online_courseDB to perform basic data retrieval and analysis using SELECT statements. The database includes a table called courses with course details such as course name, category, enrollment limit, and the number of students enrolled.

## These are the guide given by our instructor:

## Task 1: Retrieve all students_enrolled < enrollment_limit ##
- Retrieve all courses where students_enrolled is less than the enrollment_Limit.

## Task 2: Group courses by categoryb and calculate total number of students enrolled ##
- Group courses by tgory and calculate the total number of students enrolled for each category.

## Task 3: Retrieve students_enrolled = enrollment ##
- Retrieve the courses that are fully enrolled (i.e., students_enrolled equals.

## Task 4: Calculate total number of students enrolled ##
- Calculate the total number of students eftrolled across all courses

## Task 5: Sort by students_enrolled in ascending order
- Sort courses by stadents_enrolled in ascending order.
